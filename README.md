Question: Why does HIV-2 bind less efficiently to the CD4 cell surface compared to HIV-1?  

Hypothesis: If HIV-2 binds less efficiently to the CD4 cell receptors compared to HIV-1, then the HIV-2 and the CD4 cell surface have worse protein protein interaction compared to HIV-1 and the CD4 cell surface.
